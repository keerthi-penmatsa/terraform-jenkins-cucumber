Feature: Scripted install of Jenkins
    As a continuous delivery engineer
    I would like Jenkins to be installed and configured correctly
    so that that my Jenkins server will work as expected

    Background:
#        Given I am testing the local environment
    Given I am sshed into the \w*\s*environment

    Scenario: Is ruby 2.3.3 installed
        When I run "ruby -v"
        Then I should see "ruby 2.3.3"

    Scenario: Is the hostname set correctly?
        When I run "hostname"
        Then I should see "local"
